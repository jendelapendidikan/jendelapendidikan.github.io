                        Long time ago in West Java, lived a beautiful girl named Dayang Sumbi. She was also smart and clever. Her beauty and intelligence made a prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. The prince asked permission from his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his father approved on one condition, when they had a child, the prince would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.<br /><br />They get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.<br /><br />Sangkuriang feel sad and also confused. How can his mother love a dog more than him? Sangkuriang then decided to go away from their home and went on a journey. In the morning, Dayang Sumbi finally stopped crying. She started to feel better, so she went to find Sangkuriang. But her son was no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.<br /><br />And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang on the head.<br /><br />After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.<br /><br />Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.<br /><br />Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from the word Bendung, which means Dam).<br /><br />#dah gitu aja<br />#semoga bermanfaat<br />

                        The Story of Sangkuriang<br /><br />In ancient times, in West Java there lived a princess called Dayang Sumbi. She had a son named Sangkuriang. The kid was very fond of hunting in the forest. He was always accompanied by a pet dog named Tumang when he went for hunting. Tumang was actually an incarnation of God, and was also the real father of Sangkuriang, but Sangkuriang did not know it and his mother was deliberately kept it a secret.<br /><br />One day, as usual Sangkuriang went to the forest for hunting. After arriving in the forest, Sangkuriang began to look for game. He saw a bird perched on a branch, then without a second thought Sangkuriang immediately shot on target. Sangkuriang then ordered Tumang to chase his quarry earlier, but the Tumang kept silent and did not want to follow the order of Sangkuriang. He was very annoyed. Then he expelled Tumang and did not allowed him to go home again.<br /><br />Arriving at home, Sangkuriang told the incident to his mother. Upon hearing the story of his son, Dayang Sumbi was very angry. She picked up a spoon of rice, and banged on Sangkuriang’s head. Disappointed with his mother’s treatment, Sangkuriang decided to go wandering, and left his home.<br /><br />After the incident, Dayang Sumbi regretted her actions. She prayed daily, and asked that one day she was able to meet her son again. Because of the sincerity of Dayang Sumbi’s prayer, then God gave her a gift of eternal beauty and young age forever.<br /><br />After Sangkuriang was wandering for several years, he finally intended to return to his hometown. Once he was there, he was very surprised because his hometown had changed completely. Sangkuriang’s happiness increased when he met a very beautiful woman, Dayang Sumbi. Fascinated by the beauty of the woman, Sangkuriang immediately proposed her. Finally Sangkuriang proposal was accepted by Dayang Sumbi, and she agreed to be married in the near future.<br /><br />One day, Sangkuriang asked permission of his wife to hunt in the forest. Before leaving, he asked Dayang Sumbi to tighten and to tidy up his boat. Dayang Sumbi was surprised because when she loosened the headband Sangkuriang, she saw a scar. That scar seemed like his son’s. After asking Sangkuriang about the cause of the wound, Dayang Sumbi’s surprised grew increasingly because it was true that her husband was her own child.<br />Dayang Sumbi was very confused, because it was impossible to marry her own son. After Sangkuriang came home from hunting, Dayang Sumbi tried to talk to Sangkuriang, so Sangkuriang canceled their wedding plans. Dayang Sumbi’s request was not approved by Sangkuriang.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi thought how to make their marriage never happen. After thinking hard, finally Dayang Sumbi found the best way. She proposed two conditions to Sangkuriang. If Sangkuriang could meet both these conditions, then Dayang Sumbi wanted to be his wife, but otherwise if it failed then the wedding would be canceled. The first condition was she wanted the Citarum River to be dammed. And the second was she asked Sangkuriang to make a very big boat to cross the river. The second condition must be finished before dawn.<br /><br />Sangkuriang undertook both Dayang Sumbi’s requests, and promised to finish it before dawn. With his supernatural powers, Sangkuriang then mobilized his friends from the jinn to help him complete the task. Secretly, Dayang Sumbi peeked the work of Sangkuriang. How surprised she was. Sangkuriang almost finished all the conditions given by Dayang Sumbi before dawn.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi then asked her neighbors for a red silk cloth in the east of the city. When she saw the color of red in the east of the city, Sangkuriang thought that the day was early morning. Sangkuriang immediately stopped his job and felt unable to meet the requirements proposed by Dayang Sumbi.<br /><br />With a sense of annoyance and disappointment, Sangkuriang then break through the dam that he had made himself. Because the dam collapsed, there was flooding and the whole city was inundated. Sangkuriang also kicked the big boat he had made. The canoe floated and fell facedown, then into a mountain called Tangkuban Perahu.<br /><br /><br /><br />

(Cape Weeps)


<br />

Once upon a time there were a great empire on the island of Halmahera. 
King had recently died. He left two sons and one daughter. They named 
Majesty Arif, son Binaut Majesty and Majesty Princess Nuri. Binaut 
king’s sons really wanted the position as king to succeed his father. 
The desire was conveyed to the royal governor. “I had to replace the 
position of my father.” Said Binaut to the duke with confidence.

<br />

In order for the duke of supporting the plan, then Binaut gave promise 
that the office of the regent will be retained, and he will be rewarded 
gold diamond. Thanks persuasions and promises that, the duke agreed to 
support Binaut be king. The duke immediately set the royal guards to 
catch Majesty the Queen, Son and Daughter Sire Sire Arif Nuri. Once 
captured, they were thrown in the dungeon.

<br />

“Kanda Binaut really cruel! Greedy! Do not know myself! “Vituperation 
daughter Nuri sire with great emotion. However, Majesty Queen requested 
that Nuri patience and resignation in the face of this ordeal. “The 
truth will seem right and wrong will seem wrong. And the one that would 
later receive a just punishment, “said Majesty the Queen entertains with
 full of motherhood, how very hurt to see his biological son atrocities.

<br />

Binaut feel excited after plunging mother and siblings to prison. He 
announced to the people that the royal Majesty the Queen and their 
children experiencing disaster at sea. At that, the king’s son Binaut 
ask the court to the authorities immediately sworn in as king. Since 
then, the King Binaut being arrogant and snobby. He is considered as the
 most powerful king on earth.

<br />

For the benefit of himself, he ordered all the people of the kingdom to 
work diligently to build a magnificent palace. In addition, various 
levies imposed taxes, including taxes crops, animal tax, land tax. 
“Unbelievable! King Binaut exploiters and oppressors of the people, 
“said one resident to another. They complained to the regulations issued
 by the King Binaut extremely detrimental to the people. However, they 
are afraid to protest, let alone stand up to the king, must be punished 
heavily.

<br />

There was a palace maid named Wisdom. He escaped from the palace and 
form a formidable force against the king Binaut. At the very least, they
 can free Majesty the Queen and her son and daughter. “We must act 
quickly to save them,” Wise said hopefully. This is supported by his 
friends.

emaciated because during incarceration in the basement rarely eat and 
drink. Wise also convey to Your Majesty the Queen will hold the attack 
on the palace. But Majesty the Queen does not agree, he did not want 
blood on their own people. Greed, cruelty, envy and jealousy to be 
inferior to that submitted petitions to the Lord.

supported the King’s decision eventually Binaut not happy with the 
behavior of the King. But he did not dare to issue a stance against. If 
that made sure he was fired and thrown in jail. When the prison was 
filled with the detainees. “Who against King, punishment penjaralah 
place.” That arrogance King Binaut. Because he was the most powerful and

<br />

Namn unexpectedly, a natural disaster occurs. A very powerful volcanic 
eruption. Hot lava flows in all directions. Binaut King’s Palace was the
 subject of hot lava. Apparently most of the hot lava had devastating

knowing where to go.

<br />

Surprisingly, lava as if chasing wherever the King Binaut run. 
“Please-please!” Cried Binaut. Hot lava that gradually Binaut foot 
stuck. Immediately his feet blistered and peeling skin. He tried to not 
stop running. Hot lava began to creep into his body. He was tortured. 
When he suffered torture hot lava that he remembers his mother. He 
begged forgiveness. “Forgive me, Mom! Excuse me, ma’am! I can not endure
 this suffering! I will not betray my mother, brother and sister Arif 
Nuri again. Please forgive me! Mom! Mom! “Shouted Binaut pain. But the 
cry is lost slowly and eventually he died.

<br />

into a cape. That said, the cape was often heard people crying for mercy
 because they suffered extreme torture. Now the place was called the

                        <p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Title: The Lost Key</p><p></p><p>Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a young girl named Lily. She was known for her adventurous spirit and curiosity. One day, while playing in the forest near her house, Lily stumbled upon a mysterious key hidden among the bushes. Intrigued by the key, she decided to embark on a quest to discover its purpose.</p><p></p><p>Lily carried the key with her everywhere she went. She showed it to her family and friends, hoping someone could unravel its mystery. But no one had seen a key like that before. Determined to find answers, Lily set off on a journey to seek the guidance of the wise old wizard who lived deep in the enchanted forest.</p><p></p><p>As she walked through the dense forest, Lily encountered various challenges and obstacles. She bravely faced them all, never losing hope. After days of travel, she finally reached the wizard's cottage. The wise old wizard welcomed her warmly and listened attentively to her story.</p><p></p><p>The wizard examined the key carefully and smiled. He revealed that the key belonged to a long-lost treasure hidden in the heart of the forest. Legends said that whoever found the key and unlocked the treasure would be granted a single wish.</p><p></p><p>Excited by the prospect of discovering the treasure and making a wish, Lily followed the wizard's instructions to find the secret location. With the key in her hand, she navigated through the forest, following a series of clues. Finally, she reached a hidden cave covered in moss and vines.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Lily inserted the key into the lock and turned it. The sound of creaking echoed through the cave as a door opened, revealing a room filled with shimmering jewels and sparkling treasures. Overwhelmed by the sight, Lily felt a surge of gratitude and decided to use her wish for the betterment of her village.</p><p></p><p>She wished for prosperity, happiness, and unity among the villagers. The moment she made her wish, a gentle breeze swept through the forest, carrying her wish to every corner of the village. From that day forward, the village flourished, and the people lived harmoniously.</p><p></p><p>Lily returned home, her heart filled with joy and contentment. The lost key had not only unlocked a treasure but also brought prosperity and happiness to her beloved village. She realized that sometimes the greatest treasures are not material possessions but the positive impact we can create for others.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p> China, as you know, the Emperor is a Chinaman, and all the people around him are Chinamen too. It is many years since the story I am going to tell you happened, but that is all the more reason for telling it, to avoid it being forgotten.
</p><p>
</p><p>The emperor’s palace was the most beautiful thing in the world. It was made entirely of the finest porcelain, very costly, but at the same time so fragile that it could only be touched with the very greatest care. There were the most extraordinary flowers to be seen in the garden; the most beautiful ones had little silver bells tied to them, which tinkled all the time, so that nobody could pass the flowers without looking at them. Every little detail in the garden had been most carefully thought out, and it was so big, that even the gardener himself did not know where it ended. If you went on walking, you came to beautiful woods with high trees and deep lakes. The wood went all the way to the sea, which was deep and blue, deep enough for large ships to sail up right under the branches of the trees. Among these trees lived a nightingale, which sang so wonderfully, that even the poor fisherman, who had plenty of other things to do, lay still to listen to it, when he was out at night drawing in his fishing nets. ‘Heavens, how beautiful it is!’ he said, but then he had to go back to work and forgot it. The next night when he heard it again he would again exclaim, ‘Heavens, how beautiful it is!’
</p><p>
</p><p>Travellers came to the emperor’s city, from every country in the world. They admired everything very much, especially the palace and the gardens, but when they heard the nightingale they all said, ‘This is better than anything!’
