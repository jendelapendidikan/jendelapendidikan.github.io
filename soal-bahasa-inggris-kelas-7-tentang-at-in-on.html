 I am so glad that today is over. So many things have gone wrong. For some reasons I didn’t sleep a wink last night. I was very tired when Mum called me this morning. I fell asleep again until Mum called me again. That snooze made me late.
 I did not have time for breakfast. I was starving as I ran to catch the school bus. I just missed it. Dad had to ride me to school. He was late for teaching at his school and he was furious with me. He scolded me for being late.
 I arrived at school on time. The teacher asked us to hand in our homework. My homework was not in my bag. I had forgotten to put it in my bag the night before. I usually check my bag in the morning. I did not do this because I was late I had to do extra assignment as a punishment.
 After Biology lesson, I did not tie my shoelace properly. I tripped over it. And fell down the stairs. I hurt my knee and had to have a bandage on it. What a terrible day! I hope that I have much better one tomorrow.
