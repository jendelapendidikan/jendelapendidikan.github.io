Galileo developed a superior telescope and mademany significant discoveries in astronomy. He was sentenced to life imprisonment by the inquisition for hissupport for the Copernican theory that the sun was at the centre of the solar system.Galileo was born in Florence, Italy in 1564 to a poor but noble family His parents recognized their child'sinnate intelligence and talents and so made sacrifices to have him educated. At his father's insistence, Galileostudied the profitable career of medicine. But, at the University of Pisa, Galileo became fascinated in a widerange of subjects. He was also critical of many of Aristotle's teaching which had dominated education for thepast 2,000 years.Galileo was appointed to be a mathematics professor at the University of Pisa, but his strident criticisms ofAristotle left him isolated among his contemporaries. After three years of persecution, he resigned and wentthe University of Padua, where he taught maths.

Earthquake
Earthquake is a natural process that often occurs around us. It can produce a big shock of waves that can destroy anything. The earthquake is also very difficult to be predicted. However, earthquake’s power can be measured using a tool called seismograph. There are two types of earthquakes that categorized by geological factors and the area where the earthquake occurred. Both of types are tectonic and volcanic.
Tectonic earthquakes are one of the most common earthquakes. This occurred when the earth’s crust rocks broken because geological force created by the movement of tectonic plates. This type of earthquakes can cause any damage or natural disaster. Its strong vibrations are capable to spread into other parts of the earth quickly.
The second is volcanic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes occur due to magma activity inside the volcano. If the magma activity is getting higher, it will cause an explosion and earthquake vibrations. Volcanic earthquakes can be felt just around the volcano.
Earthquakes can cause the damage, if the power produced is quite large. The damages include: the buildings, the ground, and even can cause a tsunami.</a>

Brave Boy Found AliveAfter Two Days at Sea
Feeling no fear, a five-year-old boy spent two days floating at sea on a mattress in
a bid to survive from the effects of the tsunami that killed thousands of people
from his town and was reunited with his family on Thursday.
He cried as he rushed to his parents, older brother and younger sister at a refugee
camp in Meulaboh, his hometown of 40,000 people in Aceh that was one of the
hardest hit in Sunday’s disaster. Wira later calmly recounted to reporters the
amazing events that brought him back to his family, a rare tale of happiness in the
devastated province on the island of Sumatra that has seen nearly 80,000 people
killed by the flooding.
Nursing only a gash to his left leg, Wira said he was playing with his brother and
sister near his home when the waters rushed through.
According to Antara news agency, Wira said he held on to various floating pieces
of wood while being swept away. “I was not afraid because I am used to the sea.”
Wira said while massaging his wounded leg.
“As I was still holding to a door, the mattress came by so I decided to climb on it.
I was not afraid, but I was cold.” Wira said he spent two days out at sea until he
was found by fisherman on the look out for bodies off coast of Meulaboh. –AFP

Read the text to answer questions 1 to 3.The sugar glider is a marsupial, just like the many other Australian animals – the kangaroo, the koala and the wombat for instance. The sugar glider is a possum – very similar to the tupai in Indonesia. It basically lives in trees. It eats leaves and fruit. However, the Australian sugar glider has a very special skill. It can jump from tree to tree like a tupai but it can also `sort of fly’ as well. In fact, it glides or terbang layang in Bahasa Indonesia. When it jumps from one tree to another it spreads its four legs out wide; and its extra skin also spreads out and functions like a parachute.1. What does the text tell us about?…A.  The kangaroo B.

Earthquake
Earthquake is a natural process that often occurs around us. It can produce a big shock of waves that can destroy anything. The earthquake is also very difficult to be predicted. However, earthquake’s power can be measured using a tool called seismograph. There are two types of earthquakes that categorized by geological factors and the area where the earthquake occurred. Both of types are tectonic and volcanic.
Tectonic earthquakes are one of the most common earthquakes. This occurred when the earth’s crust rocks broken because geological force created by the movement of tectonic plates. This type of earthquakes can cause any damage or natural disaster. Its strong vibrations are capable to spread into other parts of the earth quickly.
The second is volcanic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes occur due to magma activity inside the volcano. If the magma activity is getting higher, it will cause an explosion and earthquake vibrations. Volcanic earthquakes can be felt just around the volcano.
Earthquakes can cause the damage, if the power produced is quite large. The damages include: the buildings, the ground, and even can cause a tsunami.</h2><br />

Brave Boy Found AliveAfter Two Days at Sea
Feeling no fear, a five-year-old boy spent two days floating at sea on a mattress in
a bid to survive from the effects of the tsunami that killed thousands of people
from his town and was reunited with his family on Thursday.
He cried as he rushed to his parents, older brother and younger sister at a refugee
camp in Meulaboh, his hometown of 40,000 people in Aceh that was one of the
hardest hit in Sunday’s disaster. Wira later calmly recounted to reporters the
amazing events that brought him back to his family, a rare tale of happiness in the
devastated province on the island of Sumatra that has seen nearly 80,000 people
killed by the flooding.
Nursing only a gash to his left leg, Wira said he was playing with his brother and
sister near his home when the waters rushed through.
According to Antara news agency, Wira said he held on to various floating pieces
of wood while being swept away. “I was not afraid because I am used to the sea.”
Wira said while massaging his wounded leg.
“As I was still holding to a door, the mattress came by so I decided to climb on it.
I was not afraid, but I was cold.” Wira said he spent two days out at sea until he
was found by fisherman on the look out for bodies off coast of Meulaboh. –AFP
