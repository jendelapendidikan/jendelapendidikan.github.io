                                            Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, this slender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species. 
What can be inferred from the passage about the lifecycle of bumblebee?    
A.        The new workers are brought up by the male bees.
B.        Bumblebees hibernate throughout winter to survive.
C.        The virgin queens survive the summer and then continue the reproduction.
D.        All the bumblebee in a colony die when summer ends.
The continuation of the lifecycle depends on the skill of the queens in collecting food.</a>

Earthquake
Earthquake is a natural process that often occurs around us. It can produce a big shock of waves that can destroy anything. The earthquake is also very difficult to be predicted. However, earthquake’s power can be measured using a tool called seismograph. There are two types of earthquakes that categorized by geological factors and the area where the earthquake occurred. Both of types are tectonic and volcanic.
Tectonic earthquakes are one of the most common earthquakes. This occurred when the earth’s crust rocks broken because geological force created by the movement of tectonic plates. This type of earthquakes can cause any damage or natural disaster. Its strong vibrations are capable to spread into other parts of the earth quickly.
The second is volcanic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes occur due to magma activity inside the volcano. If the magma activity is getting higher, it will cause an explosion and earthquake vibrations. Volcanic earthquakes can be felt just around the volcano.
Earthquakes can cause the damage, if the power produced is quite large. The damages include: the buildings, the ground, and even can cause a tsunami.</a>

It has been argued that dolphin parks provide the only opportunity for much the public to see marine mammals. Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity. Moreover, most Australians would have to travel less to get to these locations than they would have to get to the marine parks on the Gold Coast. In addition, places where there are wid marine mammals do not charge exorbitant entry fee...(56)...free.
Dr Alison Lane, the director of the Cairns Marine Science Institute, contends...(57)...we need marine parks for scientific research. She argues that much of our knowledge of marine mammals comes from studies which were undertaken at marine parks.

However, as Jones (1991) explains, park research is only useful for understanding captive animals and is not useful for learning about animals in the wild.

The sugar glider is a possum – very similar to the tupai in Indonesia. It basically lives in trees. It eats leaves and fruit. However, the Australian sugar glider has a very special skill. It can jump from tree to tree like a tupai but it can also `sort of fly’ as well. In fact, it glides or terbang layang in Bahasa Indonesia.

They lived from about 230 million to about 65 million years ago. In 1842, Sir Richard Owen created the word dinosaur. It came from Greek words deinos, meaning “terrible” and sauros, meaning “lizard”. Dinosaurs lived on earth for about 140 million years.During the dinosaurian era, the days were short. The sun was not as hot as it is today. On earth there was only one big continent and one big ocean. The name of the continent was pangea (all lands) and the name of the ocean was panthallassa (all seas).There were many kinds of dinosaurs. Some of them were very big and some others were small. Some dinosaurs ate leaves and some others ate meat. Some dinosaurs could fly.What happened to dinosaurs? Dinosaurs became extinct because there was a large comet hitting the earth. The comet caused fire and it killed the trees. Dinosaurs could not eat because there were no trees on earth and finally they died and became extinct.7. What were the days like during the dinosaurian era?A.  LongB.  ColdC.  WarmD.  Short8.

                                            Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris  The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, this slender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species.

Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species.

This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species. 
Which of the following statements about the passage is false?    
A.        When the colony has been thriving and reached a sufficient size, the queen will lay male eggs.
B.         Some female eggs are lied to produce new queens bees.
C.        The declining population of bumblebee has been attribute to the inadequate food resource.
D.        Nectar and pollen are still widely available even for the choosy species of bumblebees.
E.        A large percentage of the UK area has lost its ability to supply food for bumblebees.</a>

Flood
Flooding is a natural phenomenon that usually happens in a lot of areas drained by the river flow. In simple terms, it can be defined as the presence of flood water in a vast region that covers the area of the earth’s surface.
Flooding process itself occurs when the rains come and cause water sources such as rivers, seas, lakes, and ditches no longer able to accommodate the water drop. The barren land covered with trees without overflowing water will speed up the process of proficiency level, because the trees that should absorb the water have been used as a furniture material. When the water source is no longer able to accommodate, the water will overflow and flow into residential areas and have a big impact. Nowadays, flood is an annually happening in some big cities in Indonesia, especially Jakarta.
So, that’s the explanation of flood and how does it happen.</a>

                                            Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, this slender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.

read the and answer the questions.
 why students should stop cheating 
 People say that corruption begins with small practices of dishonesty in daily life. this is very apparent is school. the pressure to pass tests has led many students to cheat during tests. this practice should be discouraged, as cheating has no benefit for students.
 Firs, by cheating, students fail to use their own intelligence. they might underestimate their actual abilities due to anxiety and fear of failure, cheating keeps students from understanding their abilities and potentials. they might actually be able to pass the test if they study hard.
 Second, cheating on other students leads to dependency. students who don't prepare for a test well and cheat other students will get even more anxiox when others can't help them.
 Third, when students cheat, they are actually fooling and lying to themselves. if this continuest, the will be led into the habit of doing anything to get what they want, even if it means doing morally questionable acts. This habit is what starts corrupt practices. cheating during tests is a "small" form of corruption, but as time passes, it can lead to bigger forms.
 Based on those reasons, we can conclude that cheating is a bad habit that should be discourage in students.

                            4. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, this slender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species. 
What can be inferred from the passage about the lifecycle of bumblebee?    
A.        The new workers are brought up by the male bees.
B.        Bumblebees hibernate throughout winter to survive.
C.        The virgin queens survive the summer and then continue the reproduction.
D.        All the bumblebee in a colony die when summer ends.
The continuation of the lifecycle depends on the skill of the queens in collecting food.</h2><br />

Earthquake
Earthquake is a natural process that often occurs around us. It can produce a big shock of waves that can destroy anything. The earthquake is also very difficult to be predicted. However, earthquake’s power can be measured using a tool called seismograph. There are two types of earthquakes that categorized by geological factors and the area where the earthquake occurred. Both of types are tectonic and volcanic.
Tectonic earthquakes are one of the most common earthquakes. This occurred when the earth’s crust rocks broken because geological force created by the movement of tectonic plates. This type of earthquakes can cause any damage or natural disaster. Its strong vibrations are capable to spread into other parts of the earth quickly.
The second is volcanic earthquakes. Volcanic earthquakes occur due to magma activity inside the volcano. If the magma activity is getting higher, it will cause an explosion and earthquake vibrations. Volcanic earthquakes can be felt just around the volcano.
Earthquakes can cause the damage, if the power produced is quite large. The damages include: the buildings, the ground, and even can cause a tsunami.</h2><br />

It has been argued that dolphin parks provide the only opportunity for much the public to see marine mammals. Most Australians, so this argument goes, live in cities and never get to see these animals. It is claimed that marine parks allow the average Australian to appreciate our marine wildlife. However, as Smith states, dolphins, whales and seals can be viewed in the wild at a number of places on the Australian coast. In fact, there are more places where they can be seen in the wild than places where they can be seen in captivity. Moreover, most Australians would have to travel less to get to these locations than they would have to get to the marine parks on the Gold Coast. In addition, places where there are wid marine mammals do not charge exorbitant entry fee...(56)...free.
Dr Alison Lane, the director of the Cairns Marine Science Institute, contends...(57)...we need marine parks for scientific research. She argues that much of our knowledge of marine mammals comes from studies which were undertaken at marine parks. The knowledge which is obtained at marine parks, so this argument  goes, can be useful for planning for...(58).... However, as Jones (1991) explains, park research is only useful for understanding captive animals and is not useful for learning about animals in the wild. Dolphin and whale biology changes in marine park conditions. Their diets are different, they have significantly lower life spans and they are ...(59).... In addition, marine mammals in dolphin parks are trained and this means that patterns of social behaviour are changed. Therefore, research ...(60)...at marine parks is generally not reliable.

Read the text to answer questions 1 to 3.The sugar glider is a marsupial, just like the many other Australian animals – the kangaroo, the koala and the wombat for instance. The sugar glider is a possum – very similar to the tupai in Indonesia. It basically lives in trees. It eats leaves and fruit. However, the Australian sugar glider has a very special skill. It can jump from tree to tree like a tupai but it can also `sort of fly’ as well. In fact, it glides or terbang layang in Bahasa Indonesia. When it jumps from one tree to another it spreads its four legs out wide; and its extra skin also spreads out and functions like a parachute.1. What does the text tell us about?…A.  The kangaroo B.

Dinosaurs lived on earth for about 140 million years.During the dinosaurian era, the days were short. The sun was not as hot as it is today. On earth there was only one big continent and one big ocean. The name of the continent was pangea (all lands) and the name of the ocean was panthallassa (all seas).There were many kinds of dinosaurs. Some of them were very big and some others were small. Some dinosaurs ate leaves and some others ate meat. Some dinosaurs could fly.What happened to dinosaurs? Dinosaurs became extinct because there was a large comet hitting the earth. The comet caused fire and it killed the trees.

                            16. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris  The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, this slender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species.

                            25. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, this slender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species. 
Which of the following statements about the passage is false?    
A.        When the colony has been thriving and reached a sufficient size, the queen will lay male eggs.
B.         Some female eggs are lied to produce new queens bees.
C.        The declining population of bumblebee has been attribute to the inadequate food resource.
D.        Nectar and pollen are still widely available even for the choosy species of bumblebees.
E.        A large percentage of the UK area has lost its ability to supply food for bumblebees.</h2><br />
                        Pernyataan yang salah pada kalimat diatas adalah Nectar and pollen are still widely available even for the choosy species of bumblebees.<br /><br />Kalimat tersebut bertentangan dengan kalimat ke-4, paragraf ke-3, yaitu Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants.<br /><br /><strong>Jawaban: D</strong><br />

                            31. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, this slender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species.

read the and answer the questions.
 why students should stop cheating 
 People say that corruption begins with small practices of dishonesty in daily life. this is very apparent is school. the pressure to pass tests has led many students to cheat during tests. this practice should be discouraged, as cheating has no benefit for students.
 Firs, by cheating, students fail to use their own intelligence. they might underestimate their actual abilities due to anxiety and fear of failure, cheating keeps students from understanding their abilities and potentials. they might actually be able to pass the test if they study hard.
 Second, cheating on other students leads to dependency. students who don't prepare for a test well and cheat other students will get even more anxiox when others can't help them.
 Third, when students cheat, they are actually fooling and lying to themselves. if this continuest, the will be led into the habit of doing anything to get what they want, even if it means doing morally questionable acts. This habit is what starts corrupt practices. cheating during tests is a "small" form of corruption, but as time passes, it can lead to bigger forms.
 Based on those reasons, we can conclude that cheating is a bad habit that should be discourage in students.
