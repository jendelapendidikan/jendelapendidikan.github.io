                                                 Jaka Tarub <br /> Once upon a time there was a widow who lived in the village of Dadapan.  She had a son whose name was Jaka Tarub.  Dadapan village was close to a wood so Jaka Tarub liked to go to the wood.  He liked hunting for animals with his blowpipe.<br />One day when he was in the wood he saw a beautiful rainbow and he saw seven angels went down through it.  He came closer and searched for them.  The seven angels were swimming and taking a bath in a lake.  Jaka Tarub looked at them while hiding behind trees.  When they had finished taking a bath, they flew through the rainbow to heaven.<br />The next day he saw the same thing again.  This time Jaka Tarub had an idea.  He searched for their dress and when he found them he took one of them.  As they had finished swimming and taking a bath, they looked for their dress.  One of them could not find her dress.  Her friends had to come back to heaven so they left her.  She was crying while staying in the water.  Jaka Tarub approached her.<br />‘Why are you crying lady?’<br />‘I lose my dress so I cannot go home’<br />‘Where is your home?’<br />‘I live in heaven.  I’m an angel.  My name is Nawang Wulan.  But I lose my dress so I cannot fly anymore’<br />‘I you don’t mind I will take my mother’s dress for you’<br />‘OK, please do’<br />‘Wait for me here, I’ll be back’<br />Then Jaka Tarub went home to take her mother’s dress and gave it to Nawang Wulan.  He asked her to stay at her house with his mother.  Not long after that Jaka Tarub married Nawang Wulan.<br />As an angel Nawang Wulan had spiritual power.  She had ability which far above human being.  She could cook rice with just a bar of rice and when it had done the bowl will be full of rice.  But there was one condition.  The bowl must not be opened before it has done.  Jaka Tarub was very surprised with her wife’s ability. He was very curious about it.  So when Nawang Wulan was away he opened the bowl.  Consequently Nawang’s spiritual power disappeared.  She had to cook as ordinary human being.<br />Several months later Nawang Wulan gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.  Her name was Nawang Sih.  The birth of Nawang Sih added happiness to Jaka Tarub and Nawang Wulan.<br />Since Nawang Wulan could not cook efficiently anymore, she needed more rice than usual.  The stock of rice in their store room diminished rapidly.  Then one day when she took rice there she was very surprised.  Nawang Wulan found her angel dress.  It was hidden there under piles of rice.  She immediately wore it and talked to Jaka Tarub.<br />‘My dear husband, now I know what you did to me’<br />‘Forgive me, my dear.  I admit that I did this because I love you’<br />‘I love you too.  But now I find my dress.  I must come back to heaven.  I am an angel.  My place is not here.  I have to go now’.<br />‘How about Nawang Sih?  She needs you’‘I will leave her but don’t worry.  I will take care of her.  Anytime she needs me I will be here.  For that purpose please build a tower. When Nawang Sih cries put her there then call my name. I will come immediately.  But I will be invisible to you.  Good bye dear’<br />Then Jaka Tarub built a tower behind his house.  Every time Nawang Sih cried he would put her there.  Nawang Wulan would come and take care of Nawang Sih.      ...... SEMOGA MEMBANTU........<br />

                        Long time ago in West Java, lived a beautiful girl named Dayang Sumbi. She was also smart and clever. Her beauty and intelligence made a prince from the heavenly kingdom of Kahyangan desire her as his wife. The prince asked permission from his father to marry Dayang Sumbi. People from Kahyangan could never live side by side with humans, but his father approved on one condition, when they had a child, the prince would transform into a dog. The prince accepted the condition.<br /><br />They get married and lived happily in the woods until Dayang Sumbi gave birth to a baby boy. The prince then changed into a dog named Tumang. Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it. Dayang Sumbi was so sad; she didn’t pay any attention to Sangkuriang and started to cry.<br /><br />Sangkuriang feel sad and also confused. How can his mother love a dog more than him? Sangkuriang then decided to go away from their home and went on a journey. In the morning, Dayang Sumbi finally stopped crying. She started to feel better, so she went to find Sangkuriang. But her son was no where to be found. She looked everywhere but still couldn’t find him. Finally, she went home with nothing. She was exhausted. She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.<br /><br />And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head. Dayang Sumbi was startled when she saw a scar on his head at the same place where she, years ago, hit Sangkuriang on the head.<br /><br />After the young man left, Dayang Sumbi prayed for guidance. After praying, she became convinced that the young man was indeed her missing son. She realized that she had to do something to prevent Sangkuriang from marrying her. But she did not wish to disappoint him by cancelling the wedding. So, although she agreed to marry Sangkuriang, she would do so only on the condition that he provides her with a lake and built a beautiful boat, all in one night.<br /><br />Sangkuriang accepted this condition without a doubt. He had spent his youth studying magical arts. After the sun went down, Sangkuriang went to the hill. Then he called a group of genie to build a dam around Citarum River. Then, he commands the genies to cut down trees and build a boat. A few moments before dawn, Sangkuriang and his genie servants almost finished the boat.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi, who had been spying on him, realised that Sangkuriang would fulfill the condition she had set. Dayang Sumbi immediately woke all the women in the village and asked them to wave a long red scarf. All the women in the village were waving red scarf, making it look as if dawn was breaking. Deceived by false dawn, the cock crowed and farmers rose for the new day.<br /><br />Sangkuriang’s genie servants immediately dropped their work and ran for cover from the sun, which they feared. Sangkuriang grew furious. With all his anger, he kicked the unfinished boat. The boat flew and landed on a valley. The boat then became a mountain, called Mount Tangkuban Perahu (Tangkuban means upturned or upside down, and Perahu means boat). With his power, he destroyed the dam. The water drained from the lake becoming a wide plain and nowadays became a city called Bandung (from the word Bendung, which means Dam). <br />

                        <p>Sangkuriang is a folktale from West Java. It tells about a son who loved his mother. This folktale has become the legend of the origin of Mt. Tangkuban Perahu.</p>Pembahasan<p>Narrative text about Sangkuriang.</p><p>          Once upon a time in West Java, Indonesia, lived a princess named Dayang Sumbi.  She was beautiful and kind-hearted. Her hobby was weaving cloth. But sometimes she could be very lazy. One day her weaving tool fell but she was too lazy to get it herself. She shouted out, “Can anybody help me get my tool? If you are a female, I will take you as my sister. If you are a male, I will marry you!”</p><p>          A male creature came, but it was a dog. His name was Tumang. He happily brought her the tool to her. Dayang Sumbi was very surprised but she kept her promise. She married the dog. Tumang was actually a man who had been cursed by a witch to become a dog. But at certain times Tumang could turn back to be a normal man. Their only son, Sangkuriang, was soon born, and he grew up to be a handsome and healthy boy. He always played with his very loyal dog, Tumang. He did not know that he was actually his father, because Dayang Sumbi hid the secret from him. Sangkuriang liked to hunt in the woods, of course with Tumang.</p><p>          One day Dayang Sumbi asked him to bring home a deer’s  heart. But, after hunting for several, he could not find any deer in the wood. He did not want to disappoint his mother and was thinking hard how to bring home a deer’s heart. Suddenly he had a very bad idea. He killed Tumang! Then he brought his heart home and gave it to Dayang Sumbi.</p><p>          Sangkuring could not cheat her. She knew it was Tumang’s heart. So, she got very angry and hit Sangkuriang’s forehead with a piece of wood and told him to leave. With a bad wound on his forehead, Sangkuriang left the village.</p><p>          Many years later, Sangkuriang grew up to be a powerful man. One day he went back to his village. He met a beautiful young woman there, and he felt in love with her at the first sight. It was Dayang Sumbi! She never got older because she had been granted eternal youth by the gods. Sangkuriang did not know that she was his mother, so she came to her and proposed to marry her.</p><p>          When he walked closer to her, Dayang Sumbi got very surprised. She saw the scar in Sangkuriang’s forehead, and soon she knew that he was her son, who left her a long time ago. She told him the truth and  tried hard to explain it to him, but he did not believe her. She did not want to break his heart, so she accepted his proposal but gave him an impossible thing to do. She wanted him to build a lake and a boat in just one night!</p><p>          Sangkuriang agreed, because he knew that he could make it with the help of his genies. By midnight he finished the lake and then started making the boat. Dayang Sumbi was thinking hard to find a way to fail him. Before dawn, she asked the people in the village to burn the woods in the East, and the light made all the cocks crow. Thinking that the night would be over soon, the genies ran fast and left Sangkuriang before the boat was finished. Sangkuriang realized that Dayang Sumbi had cheated him. He got very angry and he kicked the boat upside down. It gradually became a mountain and it is now known as Mt.

They were Malin Kundang and her mother. Her mother was a single parent because Malin Kundang’s father had passed away when he was a baby. Malin Kundang had to live hard with his mother.</p><p></p><p>Malin Kundang was a healthy, dilligent, and strong boy. He usually went to sea to catch fish. After getting fish he would bring it to his mother, or sold the caught fish in the town.</p><p></p><p>One day, when Malin Kundang was sailing, he saw a merchant’s ship which was being raided by a small band of pirates. He helped the merchant. With his brave and power, Malin Kundang defeated the pirates. The merchant was so happy and thanked to him. In return the merchant asked Malin Kundang to sail with him. To get a better life, Malin Kundang agreed. He left his mother alone.</p><p></p><p>Many years later, Malin Kundang became wealthy. He had a huge ship and was helped by many ship crews loading trading goods. Perfectly he had a beautiful wife too. When he was sailing his trading journey, his ship landed on a beach near a small village. The villagers recognized him. The news ran fast in the town; “Malin Kundang has become rich and now he is here”.</p><p></p><p>An old woman ran to the beach to meet the new rich merchant. She was Malin Kundang’s mother. She wanted to hug him, released her sadness of being lonely after so long time. Unfortunately, when the mother came, Malin Kundang who was in front of his well-dressed wife and his ship crews denied meeting that old lonely woman. For three times her mother begged Malin Kundang and for three times he yelled at her. At last Malin Kundang said to her “Enough, old woman! I have never had a mother like you, a dirty and ugly woman!” After that he ordered his crews to set sail. He would leave the old mother again, but in that time, she was full of both sadness and angriness.</p><p></p><p>Finally, enraged, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would turn into a stone if he didn’t apologize.

                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />
